Lab 03

The "Course Outlines" folder contains all 7 of the courses that taken this semester. It's a way to bring every single important date into one place.
It makes searching for the dates very simple and keeps track of which dates have already been extracted.

Both "Calendar.docx" and "Calendar.pdf" are files that contain the final product of this lab. It is all the important dates for this semester put in a calendar.
It would greatly help managing time for most of my college work.

Update: "Calendar.docx" and Calendar.pdf" went through corrections and have new versions, "Calendar Updated.docx" and "Calendar Updated.pdf" respectively.
	The older versions have been kept as they were the "official" versions.

The "Dates.txt" is a text file that contains all the extracted dates from the "Course Outlines" Folder. It's a simple way to consolidate every date.
It made writing the "Calendar" document much easier, rather than going through all of the course outlines.

The "github repo" screenshot is to show all the commits from the local repository to the remote repository. It shows that everything online is up to date.
	
Update: "github repo 2" is an updated version of the "github repo" screenshot. It serves the same purpose.
